Fresh Fiji installation:
------------------------
1) Download recent version of Fiji from http://fiji.sc/
2) Install it, and pay attention where (which Folder) it got installed into
3) Locate the folder where Fiji got installed, say it is folder FIJIROOT
4) Download both DAIS-wp13-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar and jeromq-0.4.2.jar files from
   this web page, and place them into FIJIROOT/plugins


Upgrading existing Fiji installation:
-------------------------------------
Proceed only with steps 3 and 4.


Usage:
------
The plugin installs 4 commands, each with its own GUI dialog.
The commands are available from the menu:

File->Import->Receive One Image
File->Import->Receive Multiple Images
File->Export->Send Current Image
File->Export->Send All Opened Images

Sometimes the 'Class not found' exception is always fired after running the
command (after hitting OK button in the dialogs). This has been observed
with recent versions of Fiji that come with older version of
jeromq-0.3.5.jar in FIJIROOT/jars. After installing the above
jeromq-0.4.2.jar into your Fiji, multiple versions of the same library will
exist and the wrong/old one might be picked up. Since this library/plugin
does not work with the older one, the only workaround is to remove the old
version, which might unfortunately brake something else and network-related
in Fiji.
