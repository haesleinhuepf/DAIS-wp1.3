The repository consists of multiple folders, initially of the following three folders: scijava, KNIME, C .

scijava: Here's the main Java implementation of the image sending protocol, and a sample Fiji plugin.

KNIME: Here's a KNIME source and sink nodes that call the scijava backend to do the sending.

C: Here's a C/C++ mini-library that is compatible with the sending protocol in scijava.
